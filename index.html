    <h1><strong><em>Welcome to My Second Page</em></strong></h1>
         <p> So I think I'll be practicing this kind of stuff more often. 
             This is like my 5th day on <strong>"The Odin Project"</strong> and am still trying to figure things out.</p>
         <p> I am on <em>"HTML Foundations"</em> and just finished <em>"Text Editor"</em>. 
             I figure the next best thing for me to do, since it did say to pratice, to go a step further. 
             I went ahead and implemented a new repository from <strong>GitHub</strong>, so that I can start building muscle memory.
             I have been going at a very slow steady pace and so far it's easy I think. 
             I am having fun. 
             31 hours. 
             That's how much time i have invested thus far.
             Anyways, that's all I have to say.
             I'll be making more pages like these for practice.
             </p>
